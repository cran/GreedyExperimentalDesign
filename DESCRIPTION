Description: Computes experimental designs for a
    two-arm experiment with covariates by greedily optimizing a
    balance objective function. This optimization provides lower
    variance for the treatment effect estimator (and higher power) 
    while preserving a design that is close to complete randomization.
    We return all iterations of the designs for use in a permutation test.
    Additional functionality includes using branch and bound optimization 
    (via Gurobi) and exhaustive enumeration.
